# Scrapping Plus

Laravel package for scrapping with different drivers.

This package will help you for scrapping any website, even the ones done completly by javascript. This is done thanks the different drivers that handles the scrapping.

In this package we use the next drivers

- Parser (paquettg/php-html-parser)
- Laravel Dusk (laravel/dusk)

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require weblabormx/scrapping-plus
```

## Usage

For using the Parser one you need to execute something like this.

``` php
$google = Scrapping::scrappe('https://www.google.com.mx');
$html = $google->getHtml();

// Access inputs
$inputs = $google->get('input');
$this->assertEquals(5, $inputs->count());

$first = $inputs->first();
$second = $inputs[1];

$class = $google->first('input[name=btnI]');
$title = $class->getAttribute('value');
```

And if you want to execute it with laravel dusk you just need to execute something like this:

```
$page = Scrapping::method('dusk')->scrappe($url);
$page->object->waitForText($text); // How to use laravel dusk functions directly
$page = $page->toParser(); // Convert to the parser driver
```

### Testing
